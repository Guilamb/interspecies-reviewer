Interspecies Reviewer is a Discord bot written in Rust. The primary purpose of this bot is to automatically replace social network links with variants that fix the Discord embed issues. For example, it would changes `twitter.com` links to `fxtwitter.com` to ensure proper embed rendering.

## Project Goals
The main goal of Interspecies Reviewer is to serve as a learning project for Rust. 
It' my first exploration into the Rust programming language.
